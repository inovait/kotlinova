 * Create a [Backstack] for navigation with the screens provided by this factory
 * and remember it across state changes and process kills.
 *
 * optional [id] argument allows you to have multiple backstacks inside single screen. To do that,
 * you have to provide unique ID to every distinct [rememberBackstack] call.
 *
 * Created backstack will automatically intercept all back button presses when necessary, if
 * [interceptBackButton] flag is enabled. Otherwise it is up to the caller to manually call
 * [Backstack.goBack].
 *
 * Note that backstack created with this method
 * uses [BackHandlingModel.AHEAD_OF_TIME] back handling model.
