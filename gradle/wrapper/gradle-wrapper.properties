# We have a gradle SHA 256 hash here to prevent against gradle wrapper attacks
# (see https://blog.gradle.org/wrapper-attack-report)
# To update gradle:
# 1. Find latest version and the checksum for -all version from https://gradle.org/release-checksums/
# 2. Update gradle version in the "distributionUrl" below
# 3. Update distributionSha256Sum to the proper checksum
